This is file README for Moscow ML 1.44 for Linux/Unix (August 1999)

Soon 2.00

EXTENT OF THE IMPLEMENTATION

The current version 1.44 of Moscow ML

    * implements the Core language of Standard ML, as revised 1997
    * implements large parts of the new SML Basis Library
    * implements separate compilation and a limited version of the
      Standard ML Modules language, with signatures and structures
      but no functors
    * can produce compact stand-alone executables (a la Caml Light)
    * supports quotations and antiquotations, useful for metaprogramming
    * supports dynamic linking of external functions under Linux, FreeBSD, 
      NetBSD, Solaris, Digital Unix, HP-UX, MacOS, and MS Windows'95/98/NT

New in version 1.44 of Moscow ML

    * Access to GNU gdbm persistent hashtables (structures Gdbm, Polygdbm)
    * Interface to the PostgreSQL database server (structure Postgres)
    * Interface to the MySQL database server (structure Mysql)
    * Interface to POSIX 1003.2 regular expressions (structure Regex)
    * Interface to sockets (structure Socket)
    * Faster bytecode execution (when compiled with GCC or egcs)
    * Registration of ML and C functions simplify callbacks

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

Moscow ML was compiled under Linux 2.0.35 with gcc 2.7.2.1 and libc 5.
The binary installation requires 4 MB disk space.

AUTHOR AND CREDITS

Moscow ML was written by
    Sergei Romanenko (roman@keldysh.ru)
    Keldysh Institute of Applied Mathematics, Russian Academy of Sciences
    Miusskaya Pl. 4, 125047 Moscow, Russia.
and Peter Sestoft (sestoft@dina.kvl.dk),
    Department of Mathematics and Physics, Royal Veterinary and
    Agricultural University, Thorvaldsensvej 40, DK-1871 Frederiksberg C, 
    Denmark.  Much of the work was done at the Technical University of
    Denmark, and while visiting AT&T Bell Laboratories, New Jersey, USA.

Moscow ML owes much to:
    * the CAML Light implementation by Xavier Leroy and Damien Doligez
      (INRIA, Rocquencourt, France); especially the Caml Light bytecode
      generator and the runtime system;
    * the ML Kit by Lars Birkedal, Nick Rothwell, Mads Tofte and David Turner
      (Copenhagen University, Denmark, and Edinburgh University, Scotland);
    * inspiration from the SML/NJ compiler developed at Princeton
      University and AT&T Bell Laboratories, New Jersey, USA; and
    * the good work by Doug Currie, Flavors Technology, USA, on the
      MacOS port.

To compile Moscow ML for Unix systems, you will need the source files,
gcc, make, and Perl.  Moscow ML has been rewritten in ML and can
compile itself; hence the installation under Unix has become simpler.

To recompile Moscow ML for MS DOS, you will need the source files,
djgpp, perl, and Borland C++ version 2.0 (or later).
    * Djgpp and go32 can be obtained from 
      ftp://oak.oakland.edu/pub/simtelnet/gnu/djgpp/ 
      or ftp://ftp.sunet.se/pub/pc/mirror/simtelnet/gnu/djgpp/
