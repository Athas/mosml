* The amlazy file Data.sml containing a structure called Data: parse
  as AnonStruct, then resolve in the compiler

* Avoid shift/reduce and reduce/reduce conflicts in the parser.

* Documentation: 

  - manual
  - syntax

+ Emitcode: switch larger than 256 ?  OK because the switch
  compilation in Back breaks switches into chunks of size < 256

* Size of .ui files: sharing?

+ Kit: It is functor Parse in k42.sml that causes trouble --- even
  when actions in k32.sml is commented out.  Functor Parse is declared
  in k35.sml.  More precisely, the application of functor GrammarUtils
  inside the Parse functor in k35.sml:

    structure GrammarUtils =
      GrammarUtils (structure TopdecGrammar = TopdecGrammar
		    structure LexBasics = LexBasics
		    structure ParseInfo = ParseInfo
		    structure Report = Report
		    structure PrettyPrint = PrettyPrint
		    structure Crash = Crash
		      )
  Functor GrammarUtils is declared in k32.sml.
 
  Problem: open of 

* Back.sml -- array size 65000 -> ??

* Size of mosmllex and mosmllnk
