Note about the PM prototype
---------------------------

* Getting started.
  Compile the source with the command
  mosmlc -c -toplevel Parser-sig.sml Parser.sml PMBasic.sml PMCompile.sml
  Now from the toplevel invoke the function 
  PMCompile.compile "sources.pm"

* Everything managed by pm is compiled with the command
	mosmlc -c -toplevel context1 context2 ... contextn file
  where file is a .sml file and context1 ... contextn are .ui files.

* PMCompile.compilePM returns the context obtained from a pmfile
  data structure.

* All filenames are transformed to be fullpath'ed

* changed made to the kit 
  + Parsing/Topdec.grm.sig renamed to Parsing/Topdec.grm.sig.sml (also
    in Common/common.pm) 
  + Lots of "IO." commented out in Common/Flags.sml 
  + Order of constructures changed in Common/SCon.sml 
  + Order of constructures changed in Common/PrettyPrint.sml 
  + changed substring to String.substring in Parsing/Topdec.lex.sml
  + Commented out lots of "OS." in
    Common/EfficientElab/ModuleEnvironment.sml
  + Commented out lots of "OS." in Common/KitCompiler.sml
  + Changed Word32 to Word in Compiler/Backend/
    {CLOS_EXP.sig,ClosExp.sml,LINE_STMT.sml,LineStmt.sml,BACKEND_INFO.sml,
     CalcOffset.sml,HpPaRisc/BackendInfo.sml,HpPaRisc/CodeGen.sml}
    can easy be reverted by replaceing (*Word32*)Word with Word32
  + Order of constructures changed in Compiler/Lambda/CompilerEnv.sml
  + Order of constructures changed in Compiler/Kam/CompLambEnv.sml
  + Order of constructures changed in Compiler/Cfg/CfgInst.sml
  + Changed IO.Io to Io in Compiler/Backend/HpPaRisc/CodeGen.sml
  + Commented out "OS." in Manager/{IntModules.sml,ManagerObjects.sml,
    Manager.sml}
  + Changed IO.Io to Io in Manager/{IntModules.sml,ParserElab.sml,
    Manager.sml}
  + Changed Int.toString status to "0" on line 128 in
    Manager/ManagerObjects.sml
  +
