The SML Basis Library structures Unix and Signal
------------------------------------------------

*** This release has not been tested systematically ***

This directory provides the Unix and Signal structures from the SML
Basis Library, based on the dynamic linking mechanism.  In Moscow ML
1.45 and later this will be integrated into the standard release.

The following files are included:

        munix.c         Implements the dynamic library libmunix.so which 
                        provides the execute, executeInEnv, kill, and reap 
                        implementations.

        Unix.sig        The Unix signature, with documentation.

        Unix.sml        The Unix structure (with calls to the C functions
                        in libmunix.so).

        Signal.sig      The Signal signature, with documentation.

        Signal.sml      The Signal structure (using the Posix signal names).

        sieve.c         A C program used for testing the Unix structure.

        testunix.sml    *Very* rudimentary test of the Unix structure.

You must have the following components:
        
        Dynlib          The Moscow ML foreign (C) function interface.
                        Supported for Linux, Solaris, MS Win32, MacOS,
                        Digital Unix, and HP-UX in mosml 1.44

The runtime system must be compiled with support for dynamic linking
of foreign functions (edit mosml/src/Makefile.inc to achieve this).

1. Compile the components:

        make

2. Install libmunix.so, the compiled signatures and structures, and
   the signature files (for documentation):

        make install

3. Set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to the BINDIR directory (defined
   in the src/Makefile file:

        For tcsh: setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH $BINDIR
        For bash: LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$BINDIR
                  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH

4. Try it:

        make test
