Interface to GNU gdbm persistent hashtables
-------------------------------------------

This directory provides a C interface to the GNU gdbm implementation
of persistent hashtables.

It consists of the following files:

        mgdbm.c         Implements the dynamic library libmgdbm.so which 
                        interfaces Moscow ML to the GNU gdbm library.

You must have the following components:
        
        GNU gdbm        Can be found many places on the Internet, such as
                        http://www.sunsite.auc.dk/ftp/pub/gnu/gdbm-1.7.3.tar.gz
                        A Win32 port was made by Roth (www.roth.net), 
                        get it from ftp://ftp.roth.net/pub/ntperl/gdbm/

        Gdbm            The Moscow ML library interface to persistent   
                        hashtables of strings.

        Polygdbm        The Moscow ML library interface to polymorphic 
                        persistent hashtables.

        Dynlib          The Moscow ML foreign (C) function interface.
                        Supported for Linux, Solaris, MS Win32, MacOS,
	                Digital Unix, and HP-UX in mosml 1.44

The runtime system must be compiled with support for dynamic linking
of foreign functions (edit mosml/src/Makefile.inc to achieve this).

1. Edit the mgdbm/Makefile to make GDBMDIR point to the directory in
   which you installed gdbm.

2. Compile mgdbm:

        make

3. Install mgdbm in the directory determined by BINDIR in src/Makefile.inc:

        make install

4. Set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to the BINDIR directory.

        For tcsh: setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH $BINDIR
        For bash: LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$BINDIR
                  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH

5. Test the library:

        mosml testgdbm.sml
